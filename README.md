# Understanding Multiple Linear Regression
[last updated in 12th February 2024]

Hi, I'm Enes,
In this study I will share my findings in a popular statistical analysis model MLR from the point of view of a beginner in Data Science and Statistics fields. In this work it is not the intention to reinvent the wheel but to see that our knowledge is not just copy pasting common library tools but to achieve the same through using a more manual method.

The project notes will be highly based on the following textbook;
- <b><i>Introduction to Econometrics</i></b>,  by James H. Stock and Mark W. Watson

and sites:
- https://bookdown.org/josiesmith/qrmbook/
- https://www.econstats.com/RegressionOut_3_0.htm
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares

## Main Focus
This project aims to explain the Multiple Linear Regression model by firstly interpreting the model manually with matrix approach to observe what is really going on inside then using more modern and easy approach by implenting Scikit-learn library. At the end we will attain an analysis with the model.

## Prerequisites
You would benefit a better understanding from this project if you have a basic knowledge in the following libraries:
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

## Troubleshooting
Nothing in here so far!
